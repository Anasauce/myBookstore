# myBookstore

# Description

Create a simple content management system that allows users to add, delete, or update books. Books entered in the system can be viewed in a listing, or searched for using basic searches (title, author, genre).

# Context

# Creating this web application will provide exposure to:

- Express (or other web framework)
- Javascript
- Simple relational database interactions (Create, Read, Update, Delete), with SQL practice
- Simple server side templating (to render data retrieved from the database)

# Specifications

 - [ ] Only admin user can add/edit/delete books in the system.
 - [ ] Books are listed on the home page, in groups of 10
 - [ ] Users can search for books by title OR by author OR by genre, and search results will be presented in a new page
 - [ ] Users can view book details on a book detail page, linked to from the listing or search pages
 - [ ] All code submissions are peer reviewed via GitHub PR by at least two members of the team, and master is always in a stable state (tests passed, site functions)

- [ ] Code is written in ES6 and transpiled using webpack

# Required

 - [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the MIT license.

# Quality Rubric

- Code is well formatted without any linting errors
- Variables, functions, css classes, etc. are meaningfully named (no comments exist in code to explain functionality - the names serve that function)
- Functions are small and serve a single purpose
- Code is well organized into a meaningful file structure
